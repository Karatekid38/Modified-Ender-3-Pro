- BTT skr mini e3 v2.0 for silent steppers and better surface quality
- PEI build plate for more warp-prone materials
- MicroSwiss Direct Drive exturuder for better surface quality and layer stacking
- Dragon Phaetus HF for high speed/volumetric capabilities and better extrusion consistency
  - Custom ABS mount for the hotend along with mounts for the heatbreak fan and part cooling fan
- Belted Z mod for consistent layer stacking
  - The mod interfered with the power supply, so I designed and printed custom mounts for the PSU to fit under the printer

- Software changes:
  - Klipper and MainsailOS for high speed printing, along with remote control and monitoring
  - Using SuperSlicer for better control over the printer, and better compatibility with Klippe
   - This all results in speeds of 150mm/s velocity and 3000mm/^s acceleration, with maintaining quility and part strength
